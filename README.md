# LRL Evaluation Portal - Low-Resource Language Model Benchmarking

A comprehensive web dashboard for visualizing and analyzing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across low-resource languages. This application provides interactive visualizations, comparative analysis, and detailed metrics for evaluating AI-generated text quality.

## Overview

This project aims to close the gap in AI development and evaluation by systematically evaluating the quality of sentences generated by different LLMs across multiple African languages. Through careful assessment of AI-generated text across critical dimensions, we gather essential feedback from expert reviewers that helps us understand the current strengths and weaknesses of AI-generated text in these languages.

## Features

### Round 3 Analysis (Q4 2025)
- **8 Nigerian Languages**: Bura-Pabir, Fulani, Hausa, Igbo, Marghi, Nigerian Pidgin, Shuwa Arabic, Yoruba
- **3 Metrics** (1-7 scale):
  - **Clarity**: How easy it is to read and understand the text
  - **Naturalness**: Whether the sentence sounds like native speech
  - **Correctness**: Technical accuracy (spelling, grammar, verb tenses)
- **Primary/Secondary Data Sources**: Compare evaluations from different reviewers
- **Interactive Charts**: Bar charts with error bars for each language
- **Model Filtering**: Filter by provider (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI) and individual models
- **Language Navigation**: Browse by individual language or view all languages

### Round 2 Analysis
- **12 African Languages** organized by geographic regions:
  - **East African**: Amharic, Swahili, Luo
  - **West African**: Yoruba, Hausa, Kanuri, Twi, Wolof, Yemba
  - **Southern African**: Chichewa
  - **Central African**: Luganda, Ewondo
- **5 Metrics**:
  - **Readability** (1-7 scale): How easy it is to read and understand the translation
  - **Adequacy** (1-7 scale): How accurately the translation captures the original meaning
  - **Grammatical Correct (%)** (0-100%): Percentage of grammatically correct sentences
  - **Real Words (%)** (0-100%): Percentage of sentences with only real words
  - **Notable Error (%)** (0-100%): Percentage of sentences with notable errors (lower is better)
- **Primary/Secondary Reviewer**: Compare evaluations from different reviewers
- **Language Group Filtering**: Browse by geographic region or individual language
- **Interactive Charts**: Bar charts with error bars, percentage scales for percentage metrics

### Common Features
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between themes
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices
- **Summary Statistics**: 
  - Overall Leader (best performing model)
  - Languages Analyzed count
  - Models Compared count
  - Total Samples count
- **Data Export**: Download filtered data as CSV or JSON
- **Round Toggle**: Switch between Round 2 and Round 3 analyses
- **Metric Tooltips**: Hover over metrics to see definitions
